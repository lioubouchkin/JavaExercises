Exercise 9.2:
A program that makes a list of all the words that occur in a specified file. 
The user is asked to type in the name of the file. The list of words is written to another file, 
which the user also specifies. A word here just means a sequence of letters. 
The list of words will be output in alphabetical order, with no repetitions.
The program stores the words in a binary sort tree.
All the words will be converted into lower case, so that, for example, "The" and "the" will count as the same word.
