Suppose that linked lists of integers are made from objects belonging to the class

class ListNode {
   int item;       // An item in the list.
   ListNode next;  // Pointer to the next node in the list.
}

Write a method that will make a copy of a list, with the order of the items of the list reversed.
The method should have a parameter of type ListNode, and it should return a value of type ListNode. 
The original list should not be modified
