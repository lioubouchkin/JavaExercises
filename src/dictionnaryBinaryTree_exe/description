Should compute and output the average depth of all the leaves in the tree
and the maximum depth of all the leaves. To do this, you will need three recursive subroutines:
	- one to count the leaves,
	- one to find the sum of the depths of all the leaves,
	- and one to find the maximum depth.
The latter two subroutines should have an int-valued parameter, depth, that tells how deep in the tree you've gone.
When you call this routine from the main program, the depth parameter is 0;
when you call the routine recursively, the parameter increases by 1.
