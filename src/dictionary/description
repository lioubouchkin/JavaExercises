A program that makes a list of all the words that occur in a specified file. 
The user is asked to type in the name of the file. The list of words is written to another file, 
which the user also specifies. A word here just means a sequence of letters. 
The list of words will be output in alphabetical order, with no repetitions. 
All the words will be converted into lower case, so that, for example, "The" and "the" will count as the same word.
